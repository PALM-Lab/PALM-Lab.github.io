Brigitte is an Honours student at the University of Adelaide and an enthusiastic member of the Perception, Attention, Learning, and Memory (PALM) Lab. She completed her undergraduate degree in Psychological Science at the University of Adelaide in 2023.

Her current research project examines factors that influence visual working memory processing. She hopes the PALM lab will help her develop Open Science research skills, joining its advocacy to improve science through open scholarship. She is interested in cognition and linguistics—from consciousness to categorisation—and in the relationship between semantics and language.
