# Personal Background 
I grew up in Adelaide in South Australia, and finished a PhD with Doug Vickers at the University of Adelaide in 1997. I spent 5 years post-PhD at the Defence Science and Technology Organisation doing research for intelligence analysts. I returned to the Department of Psychology at the University of Adelaide in 2001 as a faculty member, before moving to UC Irvine in 2006. I think of California as home, and I would like to think of Amsterdam as a second home. (I definitely think of Amsterdam as the perfect antidote to southern California with old buildings, public transport, great bread and beer, and crappy weather).

# Research Summary 
My research involves the development, evaluation, and application of models of cognition including representation, memory, learning, and decision making, with a special focus on individual differences and collective cognition. Much of my research uses naturally occurring behavioral data, and tries to pursue a solution-oriented approach to empirical science, in which the research questions are generated from real-world problems. My methods involve probabilistic generative modeling, and Bayesian methods of computational analysis.
