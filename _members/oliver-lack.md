Oliver is a student and researcher at the University of Adelaide, collaborating with the Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML), School of Psychology, and the PALM Lab. He has degrees in Psychological Science and Philosophy, focusing on how humans interact with AI systems. He has previously worked within AIML, the Collaborative Intelligence (CINTEL) team at Data61-CSIRO, and the University of Adelaide’s Reasoning and Decisions lab. Some of this work focused on vector-database retrieval methods for large scale LLMs, psychometric measurement of trust in various AI systems, and consensus decision-making with AI/human agents. 
 
Oliver's current postgraduate research delves into topics like trust, reasoning, anthropomorphism, and consciousness, particularly in relation to human-like AI. His recent projects explore how people perceive and trust AI, and the changing role of real-world systems in manipulating human decision-making and behaviour. Supported by the AIML Industrial AI Scholar Program and the University of Adelaide Research Award, Oliver is keen on opportunities that study how AI affects human behaviour and society.

**Project**: “An Empirical Foundation for Human Perceptions of Machine Consciousness (PMC)”

This research examines perceptions of Artificial Intelligence that concern the usage, impact, and development of AI systems with human-like abilities and appearances. PMC is a newly emerging area of concern in relation to the deployment of novel AI technologies. This project aims to pave an empirical foundation for an understanding of PMC in real-world machines.

**Supervision**: Professor Carolyn Semmler (principal supervisor), Professor Anton Van Den Hengel, Dr Jonathan Opie, Dr William Ngiam.
