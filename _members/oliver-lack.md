Oliver is currently a researcher and student at the University of Adelaide, working in collaboration with the Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML), School of Psychology, and the Perception, Attention, Learning and Memory (PALM) Lab. He has attained degrees in Psychological Science and Philosophy, subsequently working on human interaction with Artificial Intelligence systems at various institutes. His studies and research have primarily focused within the fields of cognitive science, particularly on anthropomorphism, trust, decision-making, agency, mind perception, and consciousness.

He has previously worked within AIML, the Collaborative Intelligence (CINTEL) team at Data61-CSIRO, and the University of Adelaide's Reasoning and Decisions lab. Some of this work focused on vector-database retrieval methods for large scale LLMs, psychometric measurement of trust in various AI systems, and consensus decision-making with AI/human agents. Oliver is actively seeking research opportunities that concern the impact of AI technology development on human behaviour and society.

**Project**: "An Empirical Foundation for Human Perceptions of Machine Consciousness (PMC)"

This research examines perceptions of Artificial Intelligence that concern the usage, impact, and development of AI systems with human-like abilities and appearances. PMC is a newly emerging area of concern in relation to the deployment of novel AI technologies. This project aims to pave an empirical foundation for an understanding of PMC in real-world machines.

**Supervision**: Professor Carolyn Semmler (principal supervisor), Professor Anton Van Den Hengel, Dr Jonathan Opie, Dr William Ngiam.
