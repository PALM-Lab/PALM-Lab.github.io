Dr William Ngiam is the lead researcher of the PALM Lab. He became a lecturer at the University of Adelaide in 2024.

William completed his PhD at the University of Sydney with [Prof Alex Holcombe](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HHccoXsAAAAJ&hl=en), then was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Chicago with [Prof Edward Awh and Prof Edward Vogel](https://awhvogellab.com/). 

William is interested in all things attention and working memory â€“ how and what information is kept in mind. In particular, he wants to understand how different perceptual and cognitive factors influence what is remembered. For example, how learning and experience might change how information is represented, allowing humans to efficiently use this limited cognitive workspace.

William is an advocate for improving science through open scholarship, particularly through empowering early-career researchers. He serves on the steering committee of ReproducibiliTea, a grassroots initiative to form communities based on Open Science at research institutions.
