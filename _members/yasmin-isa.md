Yasmin is an Honours student at the University of Adelaide, supervised by Dr William Ngiam in the Perception, Attention, Learning, and Memory (PALM) Lab. She completed a Bachelor of Psychological Science (Human Neuroscience) in July 2023, and subsequently developed a passion for neuroscience.

As a novice researcher, Yasmin is broadly interested in large-scale neural networks — how anatomically functional brain regions interact and their associations with psychological disorders, treatment approaches, and neuroplasticity. Yasmin is particularly curious about traumatic brain injury (TBI) and neurodegenerative diseases, alongside an emerging drive to engage with statistical methods at a more sophisticated level.

Yasmin's current research is in its early stages, and she is eager to develop a strong foundation in open science, collaborative research, and rigorous methodology under Dr Ngiam’s mentorship. Looking ahead, Yasmin hopes to pursue a Master of Clinical Neuropsychology but remains open to the possibility of a PhD, depending on where her research journey leads.

Beyond research, Yasmin contributes to the academic environment as a coffee enthusiast, team player, and dedicated personality hire.
