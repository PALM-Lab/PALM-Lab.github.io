Natasha is a Lecturer in Psychology at the University of Adelaide. Her main area of research is at the intersection of psychology and journalism, including drawing on psychological evidence and research to implement and test journalism techniques that could help to reduce misperceptions and polarisation, and increase audience mood, informativeness, trust, and prosociality. More broadly, she is interested in how we understand and combat misinformation, epistemological challenges individually and collectively, and the application of interdisciplinary and systems thinking approaches to find constructive solutions to societal challenges.
