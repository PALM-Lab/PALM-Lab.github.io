  description: The visual system can readily recognize and remember an object, rapidly binding its features (such as color, shape, orientation, etc.) into a single representation. It is not yet known how exactly this binding occurs. It is likely that the binding mechanism is a defining bottleneck of the visual processing hierarchy. We hope to make progress on "the binding problem" by using a novel whole-report task and building computational models of the object-based binding mechanism.

  description: There is a growing appreciation that our previous learning and experience can shape how we encode and represent information in mind. Our long-term memory system can readily shape how we attend to incoming visual information, at surprisingly early stages of visual processing. In particular, we are interested in how different types of learning may improve the efficiency of the visual working memory system, whether this is achieved by circumventing sharp capacity limits.

  description: Our visual system can track multiple moving objects quite well, but we are much less capable at when remembering the features of those moving objects. We hope to understand how our attentional system and the working memory interact, especially through the use of multivariate decoding.

  description: Individuals vary in how well they can attend to and remember visual information â€“ estimates of working memory capacity reliably correlate with scholastic and cognitive outcomes. In the current digital age, some believe attention spans are collectively worsening but the evidence so far is unclear. We hope to better understand what exactly drives individual differences in attention and working memory, so that we can find ways to boost performance in situations that demand attention.

- title: Probing the development of attention and working memory
  subtitle: When does attention and working memory begin to develop and mature in childhood?
  description: Attention and working memory are reliable predictors of fluid intelligence and scholastic achievement. But when do these cognitive mechanisms that underlie attention and working memory develop in childhood? And when do they mature into adulthood? We hope to test whether children of different ages show spatial organization of their perception and cognition, and whether they quickly learn to 'chunk' and make use of their limited workspace.
