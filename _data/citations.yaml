  description: Using a new 'conjunction whole-report' paradigm, we find that visual
    working memory is limited by object-based encoding, but that features can also
    be independently lost from the memory for an item. We developed a computational
    model that captures both feature-based and object-based effects.

  type: paper
  description: A review comparing and contrasting current theories and models of visual
    working memory, leading to a 'theory map'. The hope is that the theory map provides
    a common space to better discuss various empirical phenomena and move towards
    a model-based approach to research visual working memory.

  description: We developed a paradigm that leads to distinct patterns of responses
    produced by imprecise memories, and produced by guesses. We find clear evidence
    for guessing, in line with the notion of an item limit in visual working memory,
    but also suggest a resource-based model that can explain the observed results.

  description: A downsampling analysis of two large datasets measuring the contralateral
    delay activity (CDA), estimating the statistical power for detecting the presence
    of the CDA and its set-size effects. We provide an app that can estimate the statistical
    power for a given number of trials and subjects.

  description: When to-be-remembered displays contain statistical regularities, we
    can recall more items overall. However, this is contingent on subjects having
    explicit awareness of the regularities, supporting a long-term memory 'chunking'
    account.

  description: Visual working memory is better for familiar letters compared to unfamiliar
    characters, including artifical characters matched in stimulus complexity. This
    suggests learned experience can benefit the encoding of visual information.
