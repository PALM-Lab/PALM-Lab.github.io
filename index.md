# Welcome!

We are a cognitive psychology and neuroscience lab headed by Dr William Ngiam, studying visual attention and working memory – how we represent visual information in the mind and in the brain. The **P**erception, **A**ttention, **L**earning and **M**emory Lab is part of the [School of Psychology at the University of Adelaide](https://health.adelaide.edu.au/psychology/).

"We are wondering what is happening to the world. Everything is changed, changing each day. You woke up in the morning and wondered, "Is it going to get better or getting worse?". Everybody is wondering, young and old. Everything is going upside down. How are we going to stop and work on it and work together and make the world a better place to live for all of us? – Ngalangka Nola Taylor, Aboriginal artist from the Parnngur Community.
